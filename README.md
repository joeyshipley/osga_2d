Open Source Game Assets (2D artwork)
===================================

Over the years I've offered my artwork up to co-workers and friends to use, I had been storing them in a zip and handing that out. So, I'm just moving that artwork here. If you run into this, you are more than welcome to use it. I just ask that you keep it all-ages friendly.

If you end up using the work but need to add to it, please consider having your work added to the pile. 

It won't be often, but I'll add more to this as time and interest allow.
